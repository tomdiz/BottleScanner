## SwiftUI mobile app that integrates a swift package for bar code scanning



At `https://swiftpackageindex.com/twostraws/CodeScanner` you'll find the package I integrated with example.

The application reads JSON from a local file and displays a SwiftUI List of bottles with a favorite filter.

There is a plus button in the top right corner to open an additions option view. Currently, you can only scan a bar code and add a new item to the list from the data read.

# Build

To build this proiect just clone to a new folder. Open "BottleScanner.xcodeproj" and build/run.

NOTE: You need to run on a device to use barcode scanner
