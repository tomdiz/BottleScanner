## SwiftUI mobile app that integrates a swift package for bar code scanning



At `https://swiftpackageindex.com/twostraws/CodeScanner` you'll find the package I integrated with example.

This reads JSON from a local file and displays a SwiftUI List with favorite filter. There is a plus
button in the top right corner to open the addition options. Currently you can only scan a bar code
and it will add a new item to the list from the data read.
